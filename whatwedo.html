    <h1>WHAT WE DO.</h1>
   	<p>We provide hope & promote change </p><br>
   
    <p>
Cool Life Livin' is a pending non-profit clothing company. Our mission is to help prevent bullying and suicide by spreading the message of "being your own cool—uniqueness without exemption."  We do this by offering a dynamic clothing line designed to express individuality, as well as, raising awareness of the issue through motivational speaking.</p><br>

<li><p><h4>The clothing</h4></p>
	<p>The mission of most clothing companies is to brand themselves everywhere with their clothing. The more you see their logo, the more you'll buy their products. Our vision is different.  Our goal is not for people to see us through our products—it's for them to see you. The more people see our logo, the more the message of hope is spread. </p></li><br>
    
    
   <li> <p><h4>Motivational speaking</h4></p>
	<p>Bullying and being picked on comes in so many different forms.  Tony award winning actor and playwright, Harvey Fierstein said, "Never be bullied into silence. Accept no one's definition of your life; define yourself." Through motivational speaking we become the voice of victims who have been silenced and inspire hope to a path of self-realization. </p></li><br>
    
    
    
      <li> <p><h4>Upcoming event</h4></p>
	<p>We are currently in the process of rebranding our company with new products and services. As part of the rebranding process, we will be hosting a bullying prevention event in April 2014.</p>
    <p>This event will be a celebration and showcase of our new products and services and will feature keynote speakers. Attendees will rotate through multiple stations where they will participate in bullying/suicide prevention activities and exercises that we offer to schools and organizations. </p></li><br>
    
    
    <li> <p><h4>Join in the mission</h4></p>
	<p>The operation of CLL and the April event is supported by financial gifts of individuals and organizations committed to our mission.  There are many financial expenses, which include, office supplies, venue costs, security, audio equipment, tables, chairs, food, printing costs and many more operational costs.

Feeling the pain from pointed fingers

The embarrassment from being laughed at 

And the loneliness from never fitting in 

He sharpens a pencil…and begins to draw.<br><br>

Born in Chicago, Ill., and raised in Kalamazoo, Mich., Nick Reynolds is the CEO and 

founder of Cool Life Livin', a non-profit clothing company that aims to prevent 

bullying and suicide through fashion and motivational speaking. <br><br>

A business that started out as a gimmick T-shirt company. <br><br>

"The plan was for me to use my artistic ability to design and sell sports and holiday 

clothing," Reynolds said. "As I matured, the brand also matured. It became more 

than another clothing company—it became a movement."<br><br>

Making $100/week selling Jones soda in middle school, Reynolds is a natural 

entrepreneur. He graduated from CMU in 2012 with a Bachelor's of Applied Arts 

in entrepreneurship and a minor in advertisement. Throughout his career he 

has received numerous honors and awards including, first place logo design in 

Michigan Equity Network's logo competition and second place architecture design 

in Michigan's Industrial and Technology Education Society design competition.

Reynolds spends his free time mentoring troubled youth, watching movies, and of 

course—painting and drawing. He currently resides in Mount Pleasant, MI but is 

always on the go. The former CMU football player says he's motivated everyday by 

making a difference in the lives of others.<br><br>

"We want kids to know it's ok to be themselves and that there's nothing wrong with 

being different. If we were all created to be original, then why do so many of us die a 

copy?"
